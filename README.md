## Employee Creator

## Requirements / Purpose
- A full-stack web application with CRUD functionality
- SpringBoot for the backend API - (includes end-to-end testing)
- Vite/React/TS for the frontend - (includes unit testing)
- Twin.macro/styled-components for styling

## Design Goals
- The dependencies installed (ReactQuery, Twin.macro, ReduxToolkit) were used as proof of concept that reflected something I would see in larger codebases, where DX, maintability and scalability are a concern. I was also quite comfortable writing simple custom hooks, writing SCSS and using ReactContext so I thought it was time to up-skill a little further.

## Future Goals
- Login logic for backend/frontend

### More to come...
